Introducing, Canson Companion!

[*] WHO IS CANSON?

It's this little pupper below.

Seriously? Seriously! Canson is my rescue pomeranian. He is a 4 year old little charmer (bias, obviously). We are going to be making an app for him.

[*] WHY BOTHER MAKING AN APP FOR HIM?

This little charmer is a perfect lap dog, but he wasn't always this way. He used to have really bad separation anxiety. He would bark whenever he was left alone. 

Long story short, I found out a way to ease his anxiety. Whenever he barks he is asking, "Am I alone? Is anyone home?". When no one replies, then he assumes he is abandoned. A simple way to fix his anxiety is by knocking on the door whenever he barks. After a week of training, he was able to be left alone for 6 hours most of the time.

The keyword here is most of the time. Sometimes, he would bark when I leave him too long or if I leave him at a new place (say while taking a vacation in a hotel). I cannot always knock on the door all the time.

[*] HOW HAVE YOU BEEN SOLVING THE PROBLEM SO FAR?

Whenever we leave, I set a puppy cam on my laptop and I will be monitoring the puppy cam from time to time. When he barks in the puppy cam, I will send a message on my GTalk. My laptop at home has an IM set up and the incoming message notification is set as knocking sound. It works! He stops barking whenever he hears the sound!

[*] COOL! SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT SETUP?

There are several issues with this setup:
(1) I often need to check the puppy cam on the go (using my mobile phone) and immediately send a message if I find Canson barking. I would have to switch between two apps. It's annoying when I am panicking and I just want to send a knocking sound..
(2) There are several things that need to be set on my laptop ie
   - Does my puppy cam run?
   - Is the laptop volume set to the loudest setting?
   - Is the IM running?
   - Is the laptop connected to my charger
   If any of these things is not set, then my method wouldn't work.

[*] WHAT WOULD THE APP DO?

First, I would like to solve problem (1)

Version 1.0 -- solves (1)
- An app that shows a puppy cam with a knock button so I don't need to switch between 2 apps
- A listener app that plays a knocking sound when it receives a 'knock' event.
- A server to synchronize the mobile app and the web client / listener app (could be a NodeJs server or Firebase)
- Limitation: Only support one user (ie. me)
NOTE: Version 1.0 is the super basic version and going to be very ugly.

Version 2.0 -- TBD
- Haven't really thought much about it but we can expand this app in a lot of ways...
